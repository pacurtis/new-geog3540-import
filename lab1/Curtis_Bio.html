<h3>Digital Humanist & Librarian</h3>

<p class="p1">I satisfied all degree requirements for my Master of Library and Information Science degree in May 2015 and currently remain at the University of Iowa working towards an optional, specialty Certificate in the Public Digital Humanities, which I expect to be awarded in May 2016. I have been focused on digital librarianship with a strong interest in web archiving and have participated in the process of archiving physical and digital materials. I have extensive work experience in research and information management for a diverse range of government, policy, and humanitarian organizations, while also working with people from different cultures, religions, and geographies.</p>
<p class="p1">With a background in international relations and public policy, I was naturally attracted in the opening stages of library school to cultural policy questions affecting libraries, such as tensions in collection development with changes in scholarly publishing options, cost increases in journal acquisitions, and the lack of copyright adaptation to our digital culture. But I had the opportunity to work in the preservation and conservation department, which led me to a greater appreciation of the interrelated nature of different librarian roles. I began the MLIS program with a planned focus on the “digital aspects” of librarianship, but the positions I have held at the University of Iowa Libraries have given me an increased appreciation for an archival workflow that includes the care and treatment of physical materials, the creation of digital collections, and the oftenoverlooked needs and requirements of the continued maintenance and preservation of digital collections and data curation.</p>
<p class="p1">I have learned about the archival process in courses, such as Archives &amp; Media. I have built various collections using Omeka and creating metadata along the lines of Dublin Core schema. I will be studying digital preservation next semester with direct application of Bitcurator software. Currently, I am learning ArcGIS. I have worked in preservation and conservation and have now migrated into digital scholarship and publishing using a digital content management system (CONTENTdm) and an institutional repository platform (Digital Commons). I have been able to participate on both ends of the workflow that begins with the evaluation of physical collections and ends with inclusion into a digital library. My master’s poster was about the need for web archiving or else risking losing materials (increasingly born-digital) necessary for the study of events, such as the Green Revolution in Iran.</p>
